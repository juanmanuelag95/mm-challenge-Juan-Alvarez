Hi Joanna!
Hope this email finds you well,
Regarding the ticket that I receive about Question 1 I have some questions that need some clarification before actually start testing them:

 1. Do we already have some test cases created for this field?
 2. What kind of security do we include on this search-input? I kind of worry about if someone tries to inject something into the system
 3. I want to know where I can check the documentation, I am not sure what are the boundaries of this input field or if we have some limits. 
 4. What kind of testing do you want for this round? Smoke? Regression?
 5. Do we have some deadlines?

Thanks in advance.
